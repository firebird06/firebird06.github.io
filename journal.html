  			Entry 1 [10.03.22] : I was introduced to the basic structure and syntax of HTML, which is the one of the languages that I will use to code my personal website. I learned that the <head> element is the section that holds the styling of the code while the <body> element is the section that holds the actual code that shows up on the browser. Furthermore, I was taught how to use the <div> and the <p> tags properly, which are the elements that help make divisions of content on a webpage. To better familiarize myself with using HTML, I proceeded to start a journal that would be published on the webpage of my personal website.

  			Entry 2 [10.06.22] : I was introduced on how to use Github to create my personal website. I learned that I needed to make a git respository, which serves as a virtual storage that stores all versions of code. In addition, I was taught how to access and operate a terminal, which is the system that is used to get into the git respository. Using my newfound knowledge on a git repository and the terminal, I published a webpage that would be dedicated to my journal online.
